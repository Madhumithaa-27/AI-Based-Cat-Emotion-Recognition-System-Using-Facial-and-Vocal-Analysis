**1. Agile vs. Waterfall**

- **Agile** is an approach to software development where work is done in small, quick cycles, and software is delivered incrementally. It allows you to adapt to changes and deliver features frequently.
    - Deployment cycle is in **weeks/days**
    - Deployment is based on **features or requirements** (small changes delivered often)
    - **Quick response** to changes

- **Waterfall** is a traditional method where development is done in well-defined stages, usually taking months or quarters. Changes are slow and all features are released together.
    - Deployment cycle is in **months/quarters**
    - Deployment is **all or none** (large release at the end)
    - **Slow response** to changes

**2. What is Agile?**
- *Agile is a time-boxed, iterative approach*—work happens in short cycles (“sprints”), and software is built bit by bit.
- You keep improving and delivering small parts of the software from the start, instead of waiting for everything to finish.

***

**3. Values of Agile (from the Agile Manifesto):**
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over heavy documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over strict contracts
- **Responding to change** over sticking exactly to a plan

*Translation:* Agile values working closely together, building actual software that works, talking to the customer, and being flexible with change.

***

**4. Principles of Agile:**
- Deliver valuable software to customers early and continuously.
- Continuously deliver working software (every few weeks or months, not just at the end).
- Developers and business people work as a team daily.
- The *actual software* is the best measure of progress (not documentation, plans, or charts).

***

**5. Flavors of Agile:**
- **Scrum:** Used for development projects. Organizes work into “sprints” (short cycles, often 2–4 weeks long).
- **Kanban:** Often used for ongoing work (“flow”). Work items move through different stages on a board.

flavours of agile:
Great! Here’s a *simple breakdown of each “flavor” of Agile from your screenshot* to help you understand what they mean and where they’re used:

***

*1. Scrum:*  
- Used in software development projects.
- Work is divided into "sprints" (short cycles, usually 2–4 weeks).
- Each team has roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers.
- There are regular meetings ("stand-ups") to check progress.
- Focus: Deliver working software after every sprint.

*Example:*  
Imagine your team is building a new app. You plan features to build in the next 2 weeks (a sprint), work on them, and show results at the end. Then you repeat for the next set of features.

***

*2. Kanban:*  
- Used in maintenance or ongoing support projects.
- Visualizes work items on a board with columns (e.g., "To do," "Doing," "Done").
- Focuses on continuous delivery, NOT set sprints.
- Flexible—work flows freely as team members become available.

*Example:*  
Support team tracks bugs: Ticket starts in "To do", moves to "Doing" when someone picks it up, and finally "Done" once fixed.

***

*3. Extreme Programming (XP):*  
- Used to improve software quality.
- Practices include refactoring (improving code), pair programming (two people code together), and TDD/BDD/CI (testing and automation).
- Focuses on frequent small releases and close collaboration.

*Example:*  
Developers write automated tests before coding a feature (Test-Driven Development, TDD). Two developers work together at one computer (pair programming).

***

*4. Lean:*  
- Aim: Remove waste from the workflow.
- Improve efficiency by focusing only on what adds value.
- Continuously improve processes and reduce unnecessary steps.

*Example:*  
Imagine a team finds daily meetings aren’t useful, so they reduce them or shorten them to save time and only keep valuable discussions.
