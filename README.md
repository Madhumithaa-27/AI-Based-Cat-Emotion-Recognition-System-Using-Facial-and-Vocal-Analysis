This project, done as part of the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship, detects cat emotions using both facial expressions and vocal cues. It leverages deep learning models for image-based facial emotion recognition and audio-based vocal analysis, combining the two for more accurate predictions. The system supports preprocessing of images and audio, training of models, and inference through simple scripts, providing a foundation for real-time cat emotion detection and further AI experimentation.
